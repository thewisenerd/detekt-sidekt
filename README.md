# detekt-sidekt

detekt extension that shamelessly kangs IntelliJ annotations. may probably not be needed once Jetbrains releases their
gradle/maven plugin to do the same.

Inspections provided:

 - **BlockingCallContext**: inspect blocking method calls within non-blocking context
 - **BlockingCallContextReclaimable**: infer blocking calls within `Dispatchers.IO` context which can be migrated to
   non-blocking alternatives
 - **JerseyMethodParameterDefaultValue**: infer if a probable jersey method contains a parameter with a default value

## detekt run

requires type resolution, so ensure you are setting the `--classpath` argument

```bash
java -jar detekt-cli-1.16.0-all.jar \
  --plugins sidekt-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --classpath 'dep1.jar:dep2.jar' \
  --jvm-target 1.8 \
  --input 'src/' \
  --config defalt-detekt-config.yml
```

find a way to fail the build if these errors come up by setting very high weights

```yml
build:
  maxIssues: 99999 # ...? not sure what's a better way to _force_ an error
  excludeCorrectable: false
  weights:
    BlockingCallContext: 100000
    JerseyMethodParameterDefaultValue: 100000
```

## BlockingCallContext, BlockingCallContextReclaimable

```yml
sidekt:
  BlockingCallContext:
    active: true
    # debug: 'stderr'
    blockingMethodAnnotations: ['com.custom.annotations.BlockingCall']
    blockingMethodFqNames: ['com.custom.wrapper.runBlocking']
    blockingExceptionTypes: ['com.amazonaws.http.timers.client.SdkInterruptedException']
    ioDispatcherFqNames: ['com.custom.Dispatchers.DB']
    reclaimableMethodAnnotations: ['com.custom.annotations.ReclaimableBlockingCall']
    reclaimableMethodFqNames: ['com.custom.wrapper.getSync']
    blockingClassAnnotations: ['com.custom.annotations.BlockingClass']
    blockingClassFqNames: ['com.custom.dao.SomeDao']
```

### debug

prints a whole lot of debug information, please do not set this.

takes one of 'stdout', 'stderr', or a directory path

### blockingMethodAnnotations

these are the annotations which you may use in your code to denote blocking methods

### blockingMethodFqNames

in case the annotations marking the method as blocking cannot be inferred (probably due to annotation retention at SOURCE), then,
such known methods' FQ names can be configured

### blockingExceptionTypes

methods annotated with `@kotlin.jvm.Throws`, and which end up throwing certain exceptions, can be used to identify blocking
methods.

please note: this will only work for methods in your own source code, and cannot come from the classpath since `@kotlin.jvm.Throws`
annotation retention is at SOURCE

### ioDispatcherFqNames

blocking calls are allowed within specific dispatchers, namely, Dispatchers.IO; given they are specifically for the
purpose. in case you have an additional IO dispatcher, you may configure the same

### reclaimableMethodAnnotations

albeit dispatchers specifically meant for IO are meant for such "blocking" calls, there may be certain methods which
already provide non-blocking method alternatives. such methods may be annotated with a distinct annotation, and configured

### reclaimableMethodFqNames

same as `reclaimableMethodAnnotations`, but allowing you to provide FQ names to the methods

### blockingClassAnnotations

these are the annotations which you may use in your code to denote blocking classes.

similar to [blockingMethodAnnotations](#blockingMethodAnnotations), for classes.

### blockingClassFqNames

in case the annotations marking the class as blocking cannot be inferred (probably due to annotation retention at SOURCE), then,
such known classes' FQ names can be configured.

## JerseyMethodParameterDefaultValue

```yml
sidekt:
  JerseyMethodParameterDefaultValue:
    active: true
    # debug: 'stderr'
```

**JerseyMethodParameterDefaultValue**

this is in reference to the following issues; even with this being "fixed" (as in, not crash at runtime)
in later versions, this is a pitfall; since nullable parameters always get set to null
(due to how method matching works), and non-nullable values, if primitives, get set to the default values,
and if not, throw a "Parameter specified as non-null is null" error on invocation.
